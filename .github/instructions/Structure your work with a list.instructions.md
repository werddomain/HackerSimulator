if no task list is provided to you:
  - Before you start the work, create a task list in `tsks\` to enumerate the change we need to make and save it as a .md file.
  - Take the exemple of the file `tsks\exemple-task-list.md`.

After that, take one item, execute it, then mark that task item done before starting a new one.
