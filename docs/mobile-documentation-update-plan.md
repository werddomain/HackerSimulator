## Style Guide for Mobile Documentation

When updating documentation, follow these guidelines to ensure consistency:

### Language and Terminology

- Use "tap" instead of "click" for mobile interfaces
- Use "press and hold" instead of "right-click" for context menus
- Refer to "swiping" rather than "scrolling" for touch navigation
- Use "pinch" and "spread" for zoom operations
- Consistently refer to "bottom navigation" rather than "taskbar" on mobile

### Visual Elements

- Include mobile screenshots at 375px width (standard phone size)
- Show both portrait and landscape orientations where relevant
- Use actual device frames for clarity in complex interactions
- Highlight touch points with visual indicators
- Include animation or multiple frames for gesture illustrations

### Structure

- Group platform-specific information in clearly labeled sections
- Use tabs or toggles for platform-specific instructions when possible
- For complex operations, provide separate instructions for each platform
- Always list mobile instructions first, following mobile-first principles
- Use comparison tables for feature parity information

## Mobile Screenshot Guidelines

When capturing and preparing mobile screenshots:

1. **Device Selection**: Use iPhone 12/13 or Pixel 5 frame for standard screenshots
2. **Orientation**: Default to portrait unless showing landscape-specific features
3. **Status Bar**: Keep status bar clean with full signal and battery
4. **Scale**: Display at actual size or 50% for larger screens
5. **Annotations**: Use consistent red circles for tap indicators and arrows for swipe directions
6. **Motion**: Show gesture paths with semi-transparent trails
7. **Zoom**: Indicate pinch/zoom with standard pinch icons
8. **Context**: Include enough screen context to orient the user
9. **Consistency**: Use same device model throughout a single document

## Implementation Plan

1. **Audit** - Review all existing documentation to identify mobile-related gaps
2. **Prioritize** - Rank documentation updates by user impact and frequency of use
3. **Update** - Revise documentation following the guidelines above
4. **Review** - Conduct cross-platform testing of documentation accuracy
5. **Publish** - Release updated documentation with clear change notes
