## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow the existing code style and naming conventions
- Use TypeScript for new components and features
- Add comments for complex logic
- Ensure your code passes linting checks

### Testing
(Mandatory for now, until we add tests)
- Add tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request
- Include both unit and integration tests where appropriate

### Documentation

- Update documentation when adding or changing features
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful

## Branching Strategy

- `main` - Production-ready code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - For new features
- `bugfix/*` - For bug fixes
- `release/*` - For release preparation

## Release Process

1. Features are merged into `develop`
2. When ready for release, a `release` branch is created
3. After testing, the release branch is merged into `main` and tagged
4. `main` is then merged back into `develop`
