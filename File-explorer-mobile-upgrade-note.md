- **Pull Down**: Refresh current folder contents
- **Tap**: Open files or navigate into folders

### Efficient File Management

## How to Use

### Basic Navigation

1. **Browsing Folders**:
   - Tap on folders to navigate into them
   - Use the back button or swipe right to go back
   - Pull down and release to refresh folder contents

2. **File Operations**:
   - Tap on files to open them
   - Long-press on any file or folder to open the context menu
   - Use the context menu for operations like copy, rename, delete, etc.

### Multi-Select Mode

1. **Entering Multi-Select**:
   - Tap the "three dots" menu in the header and select "Select Items"
   - The UI will switch to selection mode

2. **Selecting Items**:
   - Tap on files/folders to select/deselect them
   - Selected items will display a checkmark and highlight

3. **Batch Operations**:
   - Use the bottom action bar to perform operations on selected items

2. **Managing Uploads**:
   - Select files from your device when prompted
   - Wait for upload to complete
   - Newly uploaded files will appear in the current folder

## Technical Implementation

The mobile File Explorer is built with adaptability in mind:

1. **Factory Pattern**: The `file-explorer-factory.ts` automatically selects the appropriate implementation (mobile or desktop) based on the detected platform.

2. **Inheritance**: `MobileFileExplorerApp` extends the base `FileExplorerApp` class, overriding UI-specific methods while preserving core functionality.

3. **Integration with Mobile Input Handler**: Leverages the shared mobile input systems (gesture recognition, context menus, etc.) for consistent behavior across the OS.

4. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different mobile screen sizes and orientations.

## Performance Considerations

The mobile implementation includes several optimizations:

- **Efficient DOM Updates**: Minimizes DOM manipulation for smooth scrolling and navigation
- **Lazy Loading**: Only loads visible directory contents
- **Touch Optimization**: Larger hit targets and appropriate spacing reduce input errors
- **Responsive Animations**: Smooth transitions that work well on mobile hardware

## Customization

Users can customize their experience through options in the "three dots" menu:

- **View Mode**: Toggle between grid and list views
- **Hidden Files**: Show or hide hidden files
- **Navigation Shortcuts**: Quick access to common locations (Home, Desktop, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Files not appearing after upload  
**Solution**: Pull down to refresh the current folder

**Issue**: Can't select multiple files  
**Solution**: Make sure to enter selection mode from the "three dots" menu

**Issue**: Context menu not appearing  
**Solution**: Try long-pressing the file/folder icon specifically, not just the text

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to the mobile File Explorer:

1. **Drag and Drop**: Enhanced touch-based drag and drop for moving files
2. **Search Functionality**: Full-text search for files and folders
3. **File Previews**: Quick previews of images and documents
4. **Cloud Integration**: Connect to cloud storage services
5. **Improved Sorting Options**: Additional sort criteria and filters
