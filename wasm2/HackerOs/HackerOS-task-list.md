## Progress Notes

### Current Session Progress
*Update this section after each work session*

**Date**: June 1, 2025
**Tasks Completed**: 
- ✅ Phase 0.1 - Complete project directory structure created
- ✅ Created PowerShell script for automated directory creation
- ✅ All module directories (Kernel, IO, System, Shell, Applications, Settings, User, Security, Network, Theme) created with proper subdirectories

**Issues Encountered**: None
**Next Session Focus**: Phase 0.2 - Project Configuration

### Important Reminders
- Always create analysis plans before starting major phases
- Keep this task list updated with progress
- Follow strict module isolation principles from worksheet.md
- No LocalStorage usage - everything through virtual file system
- Maintain Linux-like behavior and conventions
- Integration with existing BlazorWindowManager must be preserved
