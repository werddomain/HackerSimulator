## üìù IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

**Focus Strategy:**
1. **Start with snapping functionality validation** (highest immediate priority)
2. **Move to Windows 98 theme implementation** (current priority for Phase 2)
3. **Document and validate completed work** thoroughly
4. **Plan next development phase** based on results

**Current Status:**
- SnappingDemo component exists but needs systematic testing
- Basic snapping infrastructure (SnappingService, SnapPreview) is complete
- Windows 98 theme is marked "IN PROGRESS" but needs full implementation
- Project builds and runs successfully at https://localhost:7143

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Break down complex tasks into smaller, testable increments
- Test each component individually before integration testing
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing themes
- Document any breaking changes or new requirements

## üìã EXECUTION PLAN

**Today's Tasks (May 28, 2025):**
1. Start with Task 1.1 - Verify SnappingDemo page functionality
2. Complete Task 1.2 - Test all snap behaviors systematically  
3. Begin Task 3.1 - Design Windows 98 color scheme

**This Week's Targets:**
- Complete all snapping functionality testing and validation
- Finish Windows 98 theme implementation and integration
- Update documentation for both features

**Next Week's Preparation:**
- Plan additional themes (XP, Vista, 7, 10)
- Consider advanced features (animations, transitions)
- Prepare for user acceptance testing
