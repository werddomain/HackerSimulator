## General AI Assistant Prompt Template

Alwais start by creating a task list if the user did not provide you one. Keep it up to date after each iteration and during your codding progress by marking as completed task and by adding remark or new task. 

**Context:**
Refer to the #file:AGENTS.md  for detailed information about the project architecture, technologies, coding guidelines, and overall requirements. *Ensure your code adheres strictly to these guidelines.*

**Current Task:**
By refering to the #file:Tasks.md task file, create a task list in this file: wasm2\HackerOs\BlazorWindowManager\doc\Initial-tasks-list.md with detailled informations and reminders to closely update this task file while implementing the tasks

**Deliverables:**

* Provide complete, well-commented code for the requested task.


* Identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.

**Progress Tracking:**
IMPORTANT!!!: After completing the task, you must provide the Markdown content to append to the `progress.md` file, summarizing the work done.

Before you start the work, create a task list to enumerate the change we need to make and save it as 'wasm2\HackerOs\BlazorWindowManager\doc\Initial-tasks-list.md'


After that, take one item, execute it, then mark that task item done before starting a new one.
