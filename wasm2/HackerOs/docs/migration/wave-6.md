## Architectural Summary (ADR 0023)

1. **Optional Build Toggle:**
   - `<EnableGameDomain>true</EnableGameDomain>` controls whether `HackerOs.Game.Core` is included in host builds.
2. **Capability-Gated Access (`gameplay.domain.access`):**
   - Declared in `AppCapabilities.cs` and `app.manifest.json`.
3. **Fallback Gateway (`NullGameDomainGateway`):**
   - Returns `IsAvailable = false` and default zero-state when Game Domain is disabled or capability is missing, allowing commands like `ping`, `curl`, `nmap`, and `cat` to fall back cleanly to Phase 5 Server Proxy or standard OS simulation mode.
