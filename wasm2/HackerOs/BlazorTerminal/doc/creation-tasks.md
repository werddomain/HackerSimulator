The Blazor Terminal Control should aim to implement the following core functionalities, inspired by mature terminal emulators like xterm.js:

* **Input Processing:**
    * [ ] Capture and process keyboard input (alphanumeric, symbols, special keys).
    * [ ] Handle key combinations (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, etc. - configurable).
    * [ ] Emit events for user input to be handled by the consuming application.
* **Output Display:**
    * [ ] Render plain text output.
    * [ ] Support for basic ANSI escape codes:
        * [ ] SGR (Select Graphic Rendition) for text styling: colors (foreground, background), bold, italic (if font supports), underline, inverse.
        * [ ] Cursor positioning (CUP, HVP).
        * [ ] Screen clearing (ED, EL).
    * [ ] Efficiently render incoming streams of data.
* **Cursor Management:**
    * [ ] Display a visible cursor.
    * [ ] Control cursor blinking (on/off, rate).
    * [ ] Control cursor shape (block, underline, bar - if feasible).
    * [ ] Update cursor position based on text output and control codes.
* **Scrolling & Viewport:**
    * [ ] Maintain a scrollback buffer of configurable size.
    * [ ] Allow users to scroll up/down through the buffer.
    * [ ] Automatically scroll to the bottom on new output (configurable).
    * [ ] Adapt to resizes of its container element.
* **Selection & Clipboard:**
    * [ ] Allow text selection within the terminal.
    * [ ] Basic copy-to-clipboard functionality (Ctrl+C or context menu if feasible without heavy JS).
    * [ ] (Optional) Paste from clipboard (Ctrl+V or API-driven).
* **API & Integration:**
    * [ ] Programmatic API to write text/data to the terminal (`Write(string data)`, `WriteLine(string data)`).
    * [ ] Event for data input by the user (`OnInput`, `OnDataReceived`).
    * [ ] Methods to clear the terminal (`Clear()`).
    * [ ] Methods to control options (e.g., `SetOption(string key, object value)`).
* **Customization & Theming:**
    * [ ] Allow configuration of font family and size.
    * [ ] Allow configuration of foreground, background, cursor, and ANSI colors (provide default themes like "dark", "light").
* **Performance:**
    * [ ] Optimize rendering for speed, especially with rapid updates or large amounts of text.
    * [ ] Efficient management of the scrollback buffer.
* **Unicode Support:**
    * [ ] Correctly render a wide range of Unicode characters.
* **Accessibility (Basic):**
    * [ ] Ensure content is readable by screen readers where possible (this can be challenging for terminal emulators).
    * [ ] Provide keyboard focusability.

## VI. PROJECT DEVELOPMENT TASK LIST

This list outlines the high-level tasks for developing the Blazor Terminal Control.

* **Phase 1: Foundation & Core Logic**
    * [ ] **Task 1.1:** Set up solution structure: `BlazorTerminal.ComponentLib` and `BlazorTerminal.TestApp`.
    * [ ] **Task 1.2:** Design core data structures for terminal state (screen buffer, cursor, styles).
    * [ ] **Task 1.3:** Implement basic text rendering and line wrapping in a Blazor component.
    * [ ] **Task 1.4:** Implement basic cursor rendering and movement logic.
    * [ ] **Task 1.5:** Develop initial API for writing text to the terminal.
* **Phase 2: Input & Basic ANSI**
    * [ ] **Task 2.1:** Implement keyboard input capture and eventing.
    * [ ] **Task 2.2:** Implement parsing and handling for basic ANSI SGR codes (colors, bold).
    * [ ] **Task 2.3:** Implement ANSI cursor positioning and screen clearing codes.
* **Phase 3: Features & Refinements**
    * [ ] **Task 3.1:** Implement scrollback buffer and scrolling functionality.
    * [ ] **Task 3.2:** Implement text selection and copy-to-clipboard.
    * [ ] **Task 3.3:** Develop theming/customization options (fonts, colors).
    * [ ] **Task 3.4:** Performance profiling and optimization.
* **Phase 4: Packaging & Documentation**
    * [ ] **Task 4.1:** Implement NuGet packaging for `BlazorTerminal.ComponentLib` following best practices.
    * [ ] **Task 4.2:** Write comprehensive XML documentation for public APIs.
    * [ ] **Task 4.3:** Create usage examples and documentation for the `TestApp` and/or a README.
    * [ ] **Task 4.4:** Conduct thorough testing across different scenarios.
* **Ongoing Tasks:**
    * [ ] Maintain and update the `TestApp` with new features and test cases.
    * [ ] Refactor code for clarity, performance, and maintainability.
    * [ ] Address bugs and issues as they arise.
    * [ ] Regularly review against Blazor and .NET best practices.
