# Blazor Terminal Control - Project Definition

**Project Context:** This document outlines the plan and requirements for creating a reusable Blazor Terminal Control. The control will be developed as a Blazor component library, packaged as a NuGet package, and will prioritize C# and Blazor WebAssembly capabilities over JavaScript interop.

**Core Objective:** To develop a feature-rich, performant, and customizable terminal interface component for Blazor applications, similar in spirit to libraries like xterm.js, but built with Blazor best practices.

## I. PROJECT STRUCTURE

The project will consist of two main parts:

1.  **`BlazorTerminal` (Class Library Project):**
    * This project will contain the Blazor Terminal Control itself (`.razor` components, C# logic, scoped CSS).
    * It will be designed to be packaged as a NuGet package.
    * All core terminal emulation logic, rendering, and API will reside here.
    * Static assets (if any, e.g., minimal JS interop helpers, default themes) will be included here, typically under a `wwwroot` folder configured for embedding in the library.

2.  **`BlazorTerminal.Test` (Blazor WebAssembly or Blazor Server Project):**
    * This project will serve as a testbed and demonstration application for the `BlazorTerminal`.
    * It will consume the component library locally during development.
    * It will include various test cases, examples of usage, and ways to interact with the terminal control's API.
    * This project helps ensure the component is working as expected before packaging and publishing.

## II. TECHNOLOGY & DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

1.  **Primary Technology:** Blazor (targeting WebAssembly for maximum client-side potential, but adaptable for Blazor Server if feasible).
2.  **Language:** C# will be the primary language for all logic and component development.
3.  **JavaScript Interop Minimization:**
    * **MANDATORY:** JavaScript (JS) interop should be avoided wherever a pure C#/Blazor solution is reasonably achievable and performant.
    * JS interop should only be considered for functionalities that are inherently browser-specific and not directly accessible or efficiently implementable via Blazor/WASM (e.g., certain low-level input handling, focus management subtleties, or performance-critical canvas operations if absolutely necessary and proven superior to Blazor's rendering).
    * Any JS used must be minimal, well-documented, and ideally isolated within the component library's `wwwroot` for easy management.
4.  **Performance:** The component should be designed with performance in mind, especially for rendering text updates and handling large scrollback buffers.
5.  **Customizability:** The terminal should be customizable in terms of appearance (colors, fonts) and behavior (key bindings, features).

## III. NUGET PACKAGE BEST PRACTICES

When preparing the `BlazorTerminal` for NuGet packaging, the following practices should be adhered to:

1.  **Package ID:** Choose a clear, unique, and descriptive package ID (e.g., `YourCompany.Blazor.Terminal` or `BlazorTerminalControl`).
2.  **Versioning:** Use Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 (SemVer - e.g., `1.0.0`, `1.0.1-beta`).
3.  **Metadata:**
    * **Authors:** Specify the author(s).
    * **Description:** Provide a clear and concise description of the package and its purpose.
    * **Project URL:** Link to the project's repository (e.g., GitHub).
    * **License:** Include a license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0). Create a `LICENSE` file in the repository and specify the license type in the `.csproj` or `.nuspec` file.
    * **Icon:** Include a package icon (`<PackageIcon>`).
    * **Tags:** Add relevant tags for discoverability (e.g., `blazor`, `terminal`, `console`, `wasm`, `component`).
    * **Release Notes:** Provide release notes for each version, detailing changes and new features (`<PackageReleaseNotes>`).
4.  **Dependencies:** Clearly define any dependencies on other NuGet packages.
5.  **Documentation File:**
    * Enable XML documentation file generation in the project settings (`<GenerateDocumentationFile>true</GenerateDocumentationFile>`).
    * Ensure this `.xml` file is included in the NuGet package. This allows consumers to see IntelliSense documentation for your library's public API.
6.  **Strong Naming (Optional but Recommended for Libraries):** Consider strong naming the assembly for compatibility in some enterprise scenarios.
7.  **SourceLink (Recommended):** Configure SourceLink to allow debugging into the library's source code.
8.  **Symbols Package:** Publish a symbols package (`.snupkg`) to NuGet.org to enable debugging for consumers.
9.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the package in the `BlazorTerminal.Test` and potentially in other sample applications before publishing.
10. **Static Assets:** Ensure any necessary static assets (CSS, JS) are correctly included in the package and can be consumed by Blazor applications (e.g., using `contentFiles` in the `.nuspec` or appropriate MSBuild properties). For Blazor libraries, this is often handled by placing assets in a `wwwroot` folder within the library project, which then get bundled.

## IV. BLAZOR COMPONENT LIBRARY BEST PRACTICES

1.  **Component Design:**
    * **Encapsulation:** Components should be self-contained and manage their own state where appropriate.
    * **Reusability:** Design components to be reusable in various contexts.
    * **Parameters (`[Parameter]`):** Define clear and well-documented public parameters for configuration and data binding.
    * **Event Callbacks (`EventCallback`):** Use `EventCallback` for notifying parent components of events (e.g., user input, data submission).
2.  **Styling:**
    * **Scoped CSS:** **MANDATORY:** Use scoped CSS files (`MyComponent.razor.css`) for component-specific styles to avoid style conflicts.
    * **CSS Variables:** Consider using CSS variables for theming and easy customization of common properties like colors and fonts.
3.  **Lifecycle Methods:** Utilize Blazor component lifecycle methods (`OnInitializedAsync`, `OnParametersSetAsync`, `ShouldRender`, `Dispose`) correctly and efficiently.
4.  **State Management:** For complex state within the terminal, consider appropriate patterns. For simple cases, component parameters and internal state might suffice. For more complex scenarios, cascaded parameters or dedicated state services could be explored if needed, but aim for simplicity first.
5.  **JavaScript Interop (If Unavoidable):**
    * Isolate JS interop calls within dedicated C# service classes or methods.
    * Ensure JS functions are namespaced to avoid conflicts.
    * Implement `IAsyncDisposable` in components or services that use JS interop to clean up JS resources.
6.  **Performance Considerations:**
    * Use `@key` directive for lists of elements to help Blazor efficiently update the DOM.
    * Implement `ShouldRender()` to prevent unnecessary re-renders of complex components if their state or parameters haven't changed in a way that affects the UI.
    * Be mindful of large data rendering and frequent updates.
7.  **Accessibility (A11y):**
    * Use appropriate ARIA attributes where necessary.
    * Ensure keyboard navigability and interaction.
    * Consider contrast ratios for default themes.
8.  **Documentation:**
    * Provide clear XML documentation comments for all public APIs (component parameters, public methods).
    * Consider creating a simple Markdown documentation page for the component's usage, parameters, and events, to be included with the project (e.g., in a `docs` folder or README).
9.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling and provide meaningful feedback or events for error states.
10. **Testing:** Write unit tests for component logic (C# parts) and consider UI tests or integration tests using the `TestApp`.
11. Provide complete, well-commented code for the requested task.
12. Identify any potential issues or areas for improvement.

## V. CORE TERMINAL CONTROL FUNCTIONALITIES

## VII. POTENTIAL ISSUES & AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

1.  **Performance:** Rendering large amounts of text or handling very rapid updates in Blazor without JS interop for direct DOM manipulation or canvas can be challenging. Performance needs to be a key focus and may require careful optimization or, as a last resort, minimal JS interop for specific rendering bottlenecks.
2.  **Complex ANSI/VT Code Support:** Full emulation of an xterm-compatible terminal (VT100, VT220, etc.) is a very complex task. The scope for ANSI support will need to be clearly defined, starting with the most common codes and expanding as needed.
3.  **JavaScript Interop Balance:** While the goal is to minimize JS, some features (like perfect focus management, advanced clipboard interaction, or highly optimized rendering via canvas if Blazor's native rendering proves insufficient) might be significantly easier or more performant with minimal, targeted JS. Decisions here should be made carefully and documented.
4.  **Accessibility:** Making a grid-based terminal emulator fully accessible is non-trivial. Focus will be on basic accessibility (keyboard navigation, focus indication), with further enhancements as a potential improvement.
5.  **Font Rendering & Glyphs:** Consistent rendering of various Unicode glyphs and handling of fixed-width character assumptions can be tricky across browsers and fonts.
6.  **API Design:** Crafting a clean, intuitive, and comprehensive API for interaction will be crucial for adoption.

This document serves as the initial guide for the Blazor Terminal Control project. It should be revisited and updated as the project progresses and new insights are gained.
