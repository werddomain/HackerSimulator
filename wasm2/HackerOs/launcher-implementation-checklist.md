## Notes

The Application Launcher implementation is now complete in terms of code. The component's structure follows the HackerOS UI patterns and integrates well with the Desktop and Taskbar components. All necessary event handlers have been implemented to ensure proper functionality.

The launcher provides the following features:
- Display of all applications categorized by type
- Recent applications tracking
- Search functionality
- Pinned applications for quick access
- Visual feedback during interaction

Testing should focus on the user experience and ensuring all features work as expected across different scenarios.
