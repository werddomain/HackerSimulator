# Analysis Plan: Security Implementation

## Overview
This analysis plan outlines the comprehensive security implementation strategy for HackerOS, focusing on creating a robust security model that simulates real-world operating system security features while maintaining isolation between system components.

## Dependencies
- **User Module**: For user authentication and permission context
- **File System Module**: For file permission enforcement
- **Kernel Module**: For process isolation and resource access control
- **Settings Module**: For security configuration
- **Network Module**: For network security features

## Key Components to Analyze

### 1. Permission System Architecture
#### Core Permission Model
1. **Unix-style Permission System**:
   - User/Group/Other permission model (rwx)
   - File ownership and access rights
   - Special permissions (setuid, setgid, sticky bit)

2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
   - Role definition and management
   - Permission assignment to roles
   - User-role associations

3. **Access Control Lists (ACLs)**:
   - Extended permission model beyond basic Unix permissions
   - Per-user/per-group granular permissions
   - ACL inheritance and propagation

#### Permission Enforcement Points
1. **File System Operations**:
   - Read/write/execute permission checks
   - Directory traversal permissions
   - File creation and deletion permissions

2. **Process Operations**:
   - Process creation and termination
   - Signal sending permissions
   - Memory access restrictions

3. **Network Operations**:
   - Port binding restrictions
   - Network interface access
   - Firewall rule enforcement

4. **System Administration**:
   - Configuration modification restrictions
   - Service management permissions
   - User and group management rights

### 2. Application Sandboxing Framework
#### Sandboxing Techniques
1. **Resource Isolation**:
   - Memory space isolation
   - CPU usage restrictions
   - Disk quota enforcement

2. **Capability-Based Security**:
   - Fine-grained capability assignments
   - Capability inheritance rules
   - Capability delegation controls

3. **System Call Filtering**:
   - Allowlist/blocklist for system calls
   - Parameter validation
   - Rate limiting for sensitive operations

#### Application Security Model
1. **Permission Declaration**:
   - Application manifest with required permissions
   - Permission categories and sensitivity levels
   - User-prompted permission grants

2. **Runtime Permission Checking**:
   - Permission verification at API calls
   - Permission escalation prevention
   - Context-sensitive permission enforcement

3. **Secure IPC Mechanisms**:
   - Authenticated message passing
   - Permission-checked channel establishment
   - Data validation at boundaries

### 3. Authentication Framework
#### Authentication Methods
1. **Password-Based Authentication**:
   - Secure password storage (PBKDF2, bcrypt)
   - Password policy enforcement
   - Brute force protection

2. **Multi-Factor Authentication Simulation**:
   - Time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)
   - Security questions
   - Device-based authentication factors

3. **Session Management**:
   - Secure session token generation
   - Session lifecycle management
   - Session revocation capabilities

#### Identity Management
1. **User Identity Verification**:
   - User account lifecycle management
   - Identity attestation mechanisms
   - User profile security

2. **Group Membership Management**:
   - Dynamic group assignments
   - Group hierarchy and inheritance
   - Special group privileges

3. **Privilege Escalation Control**:
   - sudo/su implementation
   - Controlled privilege elevation
   - Temporary privilege grants

### 4. Security Audit and Monitoring
#### Audit Logging
1. **Security Event Recording**:
   - Login/logout events
   - Permission denied events
   - Administrative actions

2. **Log Management**:
   - Log rotation and retention
   - Log integrity protection
   - Log search and analysis

3. **Compliance Reporting**:
   - Security policy validation
   - Permission usage reports
   - Authentication activity summary

#### Intrusion Detection
1. **Anomaly Detection**:
   - Unusual login patterns
   - Suspicious file system activities
   - Abnormal process behavior

2. **Threat Response**:
   - Automated account lockouts
   - IP blocking simulation
   - Alert generation

3. **Security Assessment**:
   - System vulnerability scanning
   - Permission consistency checking
   - Security configuration validation

### 5. Security Configuration
#### Security Policy Management
1. **Policy Definition**:
   - Security policy file format
   - Policy inheritance and precedence
   - Policy validation and enforcement

2. **Default Security Profiles**:
   - High security profile
   - Standard security profile
   - Development mode profile

3. **Policy Distribution**:
   - System-wide security settings
   - User-specific security overrides
   - Application-specific security configurations

## Technical Approach
1. **Security Service Architecture**:
   - Centralized security service with modular components
   - Event-based security notification system
   - Clean separation between policy and enforcement

2. **Integration Approach**:
   - Security interceptors for file system operations
   - Process creation hooks for application sandboxing
   - Authentication middleware for session validation

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Caching of frequently checked permissions
   - Optimized permission checking algorithms
   - Selective audit logging to reduce overhead

## Implementation Strategy
1. Start with core permission model and basic file system security
2. Implement user authentication and session management
3. Add application sandboxing framework
4. Implement audit logging and security monitoring
5. Enhance with advanced security features (ACLs, capabilities)
6. Add intrusion detection simulation
7. Create security configuration and policy management

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for individual security components
2. Permission verification tests for file operations
3. Authentication flow testing
4. Penetration testing simulation to verify security boundaries
5. Performance testing under security enforcement

## Risks and Mitigations
1. **Risk**: Complex permission checking affecting performance
   **Mitigation**: Strategic caching and optimized permission algorithms

2. **Risk**: Security mechanisms too restrictive for normal operation
   **Mitigation**: Carefully calibrated default permissions and development mode

3. **Risk**: Incomplete security coverage creating vulnerabilities
   **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing and security boundary verification

## Success Criteria
1. All file system operations properly enforce permissions
2. Applications are effectively sandboxed with proper resource isolation
3. User authentication system prevents unauthorized access
4. Security audit logs capture all relevant security events
5. System runs with acceptable performance with full security enabled
