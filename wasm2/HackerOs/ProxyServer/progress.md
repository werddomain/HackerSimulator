# ProxyServer Project Progress Report - June 3, 2025

## Completed Tasks

### Phase I: Core Proxy Server Backend

#### Task 1: Project Setup and Architecture
- [x] 1.1 Create new .NET project for proxy server
- [x] 1.2 Set up solution structure for proxy components
- [x] 1.3 Define communication protocol specification (WebSocket vs HTTP API)
- [x] 1.4 Create shared library for protocol definitions
- [x] 1.5 Set up logging infrastructure
- [x] 1.6 Configure dependency injection container

#### Task 2: Communication Protocol Implementation
- [x] 2.1 Design protocol message schemas (JSON)
- [x] 2.2 Implement WebSocket server for real-time communication
- [x] 2.3 Create HTTP API endpoints for file operations
- [x] 2.4 Implement message routing and validation
- [ ] 2.5 Add authentication and authorization layer
- [x] 2.6 Create protocol documentation

## Current Status
- [x] **Project Started**
- [x] **Architecture Defined**
- [x] **Development In Progress**
- [ ] **Testing Phase**
- [ ] **Integration Complete**

## Project Structure
We've set up the following project structure:

- **ProxyServer.Core**: Core business logic
- **ProxyServer.Protocol**: Communication protocols and message definitions
- **ProxyServer.Network**: TCP proxying functionality
- **ProxyServer.FileSystem**: File system bridge
- **ProxyServer.GUI**: GUI application (MAUI-based with WinUI 3)
- **ProxyServer.Tests**: Unit and integration tests

## Protocol Design
We've designed the protocol message structure with the following types:

1. **Network Messages**:
   - `CONNECT_TCP`: Request a TCP connection to a remote host
   - `SEND_DATA`: Send data through an established connection
   - `CLOSE_CONNECTION`: Close an established connection
   - `CONNECTION_STATUS`: Report connection status changes

2. **File System Messages**:
   - `LIST_SHARES`: Request a list of available shared folders
   - `MOUNT_FOLDER`: Request to mount a shared folder
   - `FILE_OPERATION`: Perform a file system operation
   - `UNMOUNT_FOLDER`: Request to unmount a shared folder

3. **Control Messages**:
   - `AUTHENTICATE`: Authenticate a client with the proxy
   - `HEARTBEAT`: Keep-alive message for connection maintenance
   - `ERROR_RESPONSE`: Report errors to the client

All messages follow a common structure with messageId, type, timestamp, and optional signature fields.

#### Task 4: File System Access Module
- [x] 4.1 Design file system security sandbox
- [x] 4.2 Create shared folder configuration system
- [x] 4.3 Implement file operation abstraction layer
- [x] 4.4 Add mount point management
- [x] 4.5 Create hidden metadata file handling (.mount_info)
- [x] 4.6 Implement file permission validation

## Next Steps
1. Implement the authentication and authorization layer
2. Complete the TCP Proxying Module
3. Develop the GUI components for system monitoring
4. Integration testing with the WebAssembly-based HackerOS simulator

## Recently Completed Tasks
- Implemented comprehensive HTTP API for file system operations:
  - Created controllers for files, folders, and mount points
  - Implemented all CRUD operations for files and directories
  - Added virtual path resolution and security checking
  - Created detailed API documentation
- Completed the File System Access Module:
  - Implemented file system operations for files and directories
  - Added support for virtual path resolution through mount points
  - Created security layer to prevent unauthorized access
  - Added metadata handling for tracking file operations
- Developed the GUI components:
  - Created ProxyStatusPage for monitoring connections and server status
  - Created SharedFolderConfigPage for managing shared folder access
  - Created ProxySettingsPage for configuring the proxy server settings

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Framework Compatibility**: Ensured all projects use .NET 8.0 for consistency
- **Project Dependencies**: Set up proper project references to maintain clean architecture
- **Protocol Design**: Created flexible message structures that can evolve as the project grows
- **GUI Development**: Used MVVM pattern with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm for clean separation of concerns
- **File System Security**: Implemented a robust virtual path resolution system with security checks to prevent path traversal attacks
- **API Design**: Created a RESTful API with consistent error handling and response formats
- **Path Resolution**: Developed an efficient system to map between virtual paths and real file system paths while maintaining security boundaries
