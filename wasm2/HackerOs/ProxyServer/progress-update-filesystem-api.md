# File System API Implementation Progress Update - June 3, 2025

## Overview
This update details the completion of the File System Access Module (Task 4) and the HTTP API endpoints for file operations (Task 2.3) in the Proxy Server project. All core file system operations have been implemented, providing a secure and robust API for the WebAssembly-based HackerOS simulator to interact with the host file system.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. HTTP API Endpoints
- Completed the implementation of the `FilesController` with the following operations:
  - List directory contents (`GET /api/files`)
  - Read file content (`GET /api/files/content`)
  - Write file content (`POST /api/files/content`)
  - Delete files and directories (`DELETE /api/files`)
  - Create directories (`POST /api/files/mkdir`)
  - Copy files and directories (`POST /api/files/copy`)
  - Move files and directories (`POST /api/files/move`)

- Implemented all previously unimplemented methods by connecting them to the existing extension methods in `FileSystemOperationsExtensions.cs`:
  - Implemented `DeleteFileOrDirectory` using `DeleteFileByVirtualPathAsync` and `DeleteDirectoryByVirtualPathAsync`
  - Implemented `CreateDirectory` using `CreateDirectoryByVirtualPathAsync`
  - Implemented `CopyFileOrDirectory` using `CopyByVirtualPathAsync`
  - Implemented `MoveFileOrDirectory` using `MoveByVirtualPathAsync`

### 2. Error Handling and Security
- Added comprehensive error handling for all file operations
- Implemented proper status code responses for different error scenarios:
  - 404 Not Found for missing files/directories
  - 403 Forbidden for permission issues
  - 409 Conflict for file conflicts
  - 400 Bad Request for invalid inputs
- Enhanced security by validating all virtual paths before operations

### 3. Documentation
- Updated the API documentation in `api-documentation.md` with detailed descriptions of all endpoints
- Added proper return type documentation for all API methods

## Technical Details

### Virtual Path Resolution
The implementation uses a secure virtual path resolution system that maps between virtual paths (used by the HackerOS simulator) and real file system paths. This system:

1. Validates all path inputs to prevent traversal attacks
2. Resolves virtual paths through mount points to real file system paths
3. Checks permissions based on mount point settings and shared folder permissions
4. Maintains security boundaries between different mount points

### File Operations
All file operations follow a consistent pattern:
1. Validate the virtual path
2. Resolve it to a real file system path
3. Check permissions and security constraints
4. Perform the operation on the real file system
5. Update access metadata and logging
6. Return appropriate success/error responses

### Extension Methods
The implementation leverages extension methods in `FileSystemOperationsExtensions.cs` that extend the core `FileSystemOperations` class with virtual path capabilities. These extension methods handle the complex logic of:

- Path resolution across mount points
- Security checking
- Error handling
- Access logging
- Metadata tracking

## Next Steps
1. Implement the authentication and authorization layer (Task 2.5)
2. Connect the WebAssembly HackerOS to the proxy server's file system API
3. Implement client-side code in the simulator to use the file system API
4. Perform integration testing with real file system operations

## Summary
The File System Access Module is now fully implemented, providing a secure bridge between the WebAssembly-based HackerOS simulator and the host file system. This implementation follows security best practices and provides a robust API for all standard file operations.
