## Phase I: Core Proxy Server Backend

### Task 1: Project Setup and Architecture
**Priority: Critical**
**Estimated Time: 2-3 days**

#### Subtasks:
- [x] 1.1 Create new .NET project for proxy server
- [x] 1.2 Set up solution structure for proxy components
- [x] 1.3 Define communication protocol specification (WebSocket vs HTTP API)
- [x] 1.4 Create shared library for protocol definitions
- [x] 1.5 Set up logging infrastructure
- [x] 1.6 Configure dependency injection container

#### Analysis Plan:
```
Architecture Decision Points:
1. Communication Protocol Choice:
   - WebSockets: Real-time, bi-directional, persistent connections
   - HTTP API: Stateless, simpler, REST-based
   - gRPC-web: Strongly typed, efficient, but more complex
   
   Recommendation: WebSockets for real-time TCP proxying + HTTP API for file operations

2. Project Structure:
   ProxyServer.Core/          # Core business logic
   ProxyServer.Network/       # TCP proxying functionality  
   ProxyServer.FileSystem/    # File system bridge
   ProxyServer.Protocol/      # Communication protocols
   ProxyServer.GUI/           # WPF/WinUI interface
   ProxyServer.Tests/         # Unit and integration tests

3. Security Considerations:
   - Authentication tokens for proxy connections
   - File system access sandboxing
   - Network traffic validation
```

### Task 2: Communication Protocol Implementation  
**Priority: Critical**
**Estimated Time: 3-4 days**

#### Subtasks:
- [x] 2.1 Design protocol message schemas (JSON/MessagePack)
- [x] 2.2 Implement WebSocket server for real-time communication
- [ ] 2.3 Create HTTP API endpoints for file operations
- [x] 2.4 Implement message routing and validation
- [ ] 2.5 Add authentication and authorization layer
- [ ] 2.6 Create protocol documentation

#### Analysis Plan:
```
Protocol Design Requirements:
1. Message Types:
   - Network: CONNECT_TCP, SEND_DATA, CLOSE_CONNECTION, CONNECTION_STATUS
   - FileSystem: LIST_SHARES, MOUNT_FOLDER, FILE_OPERATION, UNMOUNT_FOLDER
   - Control: AUTHENTICATE, HEARTBEAT, ERROR_RESPONSE

2. Message Structure:
   {
     "messageId": "uuid",
     "type": "CONNECT_TCP",
     "timestamp": "iso8601",
     "payload": { ... },
     "signature": "auth_hash"
   }

3. Connection Management:
   - Session-based authentication
   - Connection pooling for TCP proxying
   - Graceful degradation on network issues
```

### Task 3: TCP Proxying Module
**Priority: Critical**  
**Estimated Time: 4-5 days**

#### Subtasks:
- [x] 3.1 Create TCP connection manager
- [x] 3.2 Implement bidirectional data relay
- [x] 3.3 Add connection lifecycle management
- [x] 3.4 Implement concurrent connection handling
- [x] 3.5 Add traffic monitoring and statistics
- [x] 3.6 Implement connection timeouts and cleanup

#### Analysis Plan:
```
TCP Proxying Architecture:
1. Connection Flow:
   WebAssembly Client -> WebSocket -> ProxyServer -> TCP Target
   
2. Key Components:
   - TcpConnectionManager: Manages active connections
   - DataRelay: Handles bidirectional data transfer
   - ConnectionPool: Optimizes resource usage
   - TrafficMonitor: Tracks bandwidth and connection stats

3. Challenges:
   - Maintaining connection state across WebSocket reconnections
   - Handling high-frequency small data packets efficiently
   - Managing memory for large data transfers
   - Implementing proper backpressure mechanisms

4. Performance Targets:
   - Support 100+ concurrent connections
   - Sub-10ms latency for data relay
   - Efficient memory usage for large transfers
```

### Task 4: File System Access Module
**Priority: High**
**Estimated Time: 4-5 days**

#### Subtasks:
- [ ] 4.1 Design file system security sandbox
- [ ] 4.2 Create shared folder configuration system
- [ ] 4.3 Implement file operation abstraction layer
- [ ] 4.4 Add mount point management
- [ ] 4.5 Create hidden metadata file handling (.mount_info)
- [ ] 4.6 Implement file permission validation

#### Analysis Plan:
```
File System Security Model:
1. Sandbox Design:
   - Whitelist-based folder access
   - Path traversal prevention
   - Permission inheritance from host OS
   - Symlink resolution security

2. Shared Folder Configuration:
   {
     "id": "uuid",
     "hostPath": "C:\\Shared\\Documents",
     "alias": "documents",
     "permissions": "read-write",
     "mountInfo": ".mount_info.json"
   }

3. File Operations API:
   - Standard CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Directory listing with metadata
   - File watching for live updates
   - Batch operations for efficiency

4. Security Measures:
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - File extension filtering (optional)
   - Size limits for uploads
   - Rate limiting for file operations
```

### Task 5: GUI Implementation
**Priority: High**
**Estimated Time: 3-4 days**

#### Subtasks:
- [x] 5.1 Create status monitoring interface
- [x] 5.2 Implement configuration management interface
- [x] 5.3 Design shared folder management UI
- [x] 5.4 Implement TCP connection monitoring
- [x] 5.5 Create settings UI for proxy configuration
- [ ] 5.6 Add real-time statistics and graphs
- [ ] 5.7 Implement logging viewer

#### Analysis Plan:
```
GUI Design Requirements:
1. Main Components:
   - Server Status Dashboard: Shows active connections and performance metrics
   - Shared Folder Configuration: Manages host file system access
   - Settings Panel: Configure proxy behavior and security
   - Log Viewer: Monitor and troubleshoot operations

2. User Experience Goals:
   - Intuitive interface for managing connections
   - Clear visualization of server status
   - Simple configuration of shared folders
   - Accessible error messages and diagnostics

3. Technologies:
   - MAUI for cross-platform UI
   - MVVM architecture with CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
   - Custom controls for real-time monitoring
```

The rest of the tasks remain unchanged.
