# Application Framework Implement## Recent Updates
1. Implemented application installation/uninstallation methods
2. Created UI components for the application browser
3. Integrated with shell commands for application management
4. Added terminal commands for application installation and listing

## Next Steps
1. Implement notification system for application updates
2. Expand built-in applications with better UI integration
3. Add drag-and-drop support for application installation
4. Create application package creation toolsProgress

## Overview
We have successfully implemented the Application Framework for the HackerOS Simulator project. This framework provides a comprehensive system for managing applications, including file type associations, application discovery, version management, and start menu integration.

## Completed Tasks

### File Type Registration System
- Created `FileTypeRegistration.cs` class to represent file type metadata
- Implemented `[OpenFileType]` attribute for associating file types with applications
- Created `FileTypeRegistry` service for managing file type associations
- Added automatic file type registration during system startup
- Implemented extension methods for opening files with associated applications

### Application Registration System
- Created `[App]` attribute for application metadata
- Implemented `ApplicationDiscoveryService` for discovering applications at runtime
- Added storage of application manifests in the file system
- Supported system-installed and user-installed applications
- Added system for application categories and organization

### Application Management Enhancements
- Implemented application searching and filtering in `ApplicationFinder`
- Added version management and update system in `ApplicationUpdater`
- Created application icons and shortcuts handling
- Implemented start menu integration in `StartMenuIntegration`

### System Integration
- Created `SystemBootService` and `MainService` for system initialization
- Added initialization sequence to `Program.cs` and `Startup.cs`
- Implemented service registration for all components
- Added application startup and automatic initialization

## Next Steps
1. Implement the application installation/uninstallation methods
2. Create UI components for the application browser
3. Integrate with shell commands for launching applications
4. Add notification system for application updates
5. Expand built-in applications with better UI integration

## Technologies Used
- C# interfaces and abstractions for component isolation
- Attribute-based metadata for declarative application definition
- File system integration for persisting application data
- Event-based communication between components
- Dependency injection for service composition
