  - Properties: ID, Name, Icon, Description, Category, IsPinned, LastLaunched

#### 2.3 Launcher Service
- **LauncherService**: Service for managing launcher data
  - Methods: GetCategories, GetApplications, SearchApplications, PinApplication, UnpinApplication, TrackRecentApplication

### 3. Taskbar Implementation (4.2.3)
The taskbar displays running applications and system status.

#### 3.1 Taskbar Component
- **TaskbarComponent**: Blazor component for the taskbar
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Display running applications
  - Show application state (active, minimized)
  - Provide system indicators (clock, network, etc.)
  - Include launcher button

#### 3.2 Taskbar Button Component
- **TaskbarButton**: Component for each application button
  - Properties: Application, IsActive, ShowPreview
  - Methods: OnClick, OnContextMenu, ShowApplicationPreview

#### 3.3 System Indicators
- **ClockIndicator**: Displays current time and date
- **NetworkIndicator**: Shows network status
- **NotificationIndicator**: Shows notification count

### 4. Notification System (4.2.4)
The notification system displays system and application notifications.

#### 4.1 Notification Components
- **NotificationCenter**: Component for viewing and managing notifications
- **NotificationToast**: Component for displaying pop-up notifications

#### 4.2 Notification Models
- **Notification**: Represents a notification
  - Properties: ID, Title, Content, Type, Timestamp, Source, IsRead, Actions

#### 4.3 Notification Service
- **NotificationService**: Service for managing notifications
  - Methods: AddNotification, RemoveNotification, MarkAsRead, ClearNotifications

## Dependencies and Integration Points

### Integration with Existing Modules
1. **Core Module**:
   - Access to system settings and configuration
   - Event handling for system changes

2. **Application Module**:
   - Application lifecycle events (start, stop, minimize, maximize)
   - Application metadata (name, icon, description)
   - Application launching capabilities

3. **User Module**:
   - User preferences and settings
   - User authentication state
   - User permissions for applications

4. **File System Module**:
   - Access to file system for desktop shortcuts
   - File operations for configuration persistence

5. **Window Manager Integration**:
   - Window creation and management
   - Window state synchronization with taskbar

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Desktop Foundation
1. Create core models (DesktopIcon, DesktopSettings)
2. Implement Desktop component with background display
3. Add icon grid system with positioning
4. Implement desktop context menu
5. Add icon selection and drag-drop support
6. Integrate with settings service for persistence

### Phase 2: Application Launcher
1. Create launcher models (LauncherCategory, LauncherApplication)
2. Implement LauncherService for data management
3. Create ApplicationLauncher component with UI
4. Add search functionality
5. Implement recent applications tracking
6. Add pinned applications support

### Phase 3: Taskbar Implementation
1. Create taskbar component with basic structure
2. Implement taskbar buttons for running applications
3. Add system indicators (clock, network)
4. Implement application switching through taskbar
5. Add preview thumbnails for applications
6. Implement taskbar context menus

### Phase 4: Notification System
1. Create notification models and service
2. Implement notification center component
3. Create toast notification component
4. Add notification API for applications
5. Implement notification persistence
6. Add notification actions support

## Technical Considerations

### State Management
- Use a combination of service-based state and component state
- Implement proper event propagation between components
- Consider using a state management library for complex state

### Performance Optimization
- Implement virtualization for large lists (applications, icons)
- Optimize rendering with proper component lifecycle management
- Use efficient data structures for frequent operations

### Accessibility
- Ensure keyboard navigation for all components
- Implement proper ARIA attributes
- Support high contrast themes

### Theming and Styling
- Use CSS variables for theme integration
- Implement consistent styling across components
- Support dynamic theme switching

## Testing Strategy
1. Unit tests for services and models
2. Component tests for UI elements
3. Integration tests for component interaction
4. End-to-end tests for user workflows

## Completion Criteria
1. All components render correctly in different themes
2. Desktop icons can be created, moved, and deleted
3. Application launcher shows all applications with search and categorization
4. Taskbar displays running applications with correct state
5. Notifications appear and can be managed
6. All components persist state between sessions
7. Performance is acceptable with many icons and applications
