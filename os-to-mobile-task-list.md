## Implementation Notes and Recommendations

1. **Start with Core Architecture**: The separation of concerns through the MVVM pattern is critical to success. Focus on establishing this foundation first.

2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Consider implementing mobile support progressively, starting with the most critical applications.

3. **Leverage Existing Theme System**: The current theme system provides a solid foundation for responsive design. Extend it rather than replacing it.

4. **Touch First Design**: When designing mobile views, prioritize touch interactions first, then adapt for keyboard/mouse as secondary.

5. **Consistent State Management**: Ensure that application state is consistently maintained when switching between mobile and desktop views.

6. **Consider Component Libraries**: For accelerated development, consider adapting mobile UI component libraries that match your application's aesthetic.

7. **Performance Budgets**: Establish performance budgets for mobile views and test regularly against low-end devices.

8. **Accessibility**: Maintain accessibility compliance across both desktop and mobile interfaces.

9. **Feature Parity vs. Optimization**: Some desktop features may need to be simplified for mobile, but aim for functional parity where possible.

10. **Testing Across Devices**: Test on multiple device sizes and orientations throughout development.
