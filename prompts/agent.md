In the /wasm/, we are creating a new webassembly version of the javascript project in /src/.
You can refer to the /scr/ for how it was implemented but never code in it.

Alwais ensure that you create fully styled desing that has Modern Look or/and Gothic/hacker style.

When you implement new features, alwais try to mimic or fake how it's really do under the hood in real OS.
This will ensure realistic emulation for the user.
