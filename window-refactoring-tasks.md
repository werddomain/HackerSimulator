# WindowManager Refactoring Tasks

## Phase 1: Module Creation

- [x] Create `window-dom.ts` with `WindowDomManager` class
- [x] Create `window-resize.ts` with `WindowResizeHandler` class
- [x] Create `window-events.ts` with `WindowEventManager` class 
- [x] Create `window-effects.ts` with `WindowEffectsManager` class

## Phase 2: Implementation

- [x] Update `window.ts` to use the new modules and expose them
- [ ] Test basic functionality after refactoring
  - [x] Create a test HTML file to verify window creation
  - [ ] Test window manipulation (drag, resize)
  - [ ] Test window state (minimize, maximize, restore)
  - [ ] Test notifications and dialogs
  - [ ] Test event handling

## Phase 3: Additional Modules

Consider additional extractions based on functionality and maintainability needs:

- [ ] Create `window-dialogs.ts` for dialog-specific functionality
- [ ] Create `window-state.ts` for managing window state (size, position, etc.)
- [x] Create `window-types.ts` for shared type definitions

## Phase 4: Testing

- [ ] Test window creation
- [ ] Test window manipulation (minimize, maximize, restore)
- [ ] Test resize functionality
- [ ] Test dialog functionality
- [ ] Test notification system
- [ ] Test event handling system

## Phase 5: Documentation

- [ ] Update code documentation in all new modules
- [ ] Create architecture diagram showing module relationships
- [ ] Update any existing documentation that references the window system

## Benefits of This Refactoring

1. **Improved Maintainability**
   - Each module has a single responsibility
   - Easier to understand and modify individual components
   - Reduced file sizes make code more manageable

2. **Better Code Organization**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - DOM manipulation is isolated
   - Event handling is centralized
   - UI effects and animations are grouped together

3. **Enhanced Testability**
   - Smaller, more focused components are easier to test
   - Can mock dependencies for unit testing
   - Easier to isolate and debug issues

4. **Better Extensibility**
   - Adding new features only requires modifying relevant modules
   - New window behaviors can be added without changing core functionality
   - Platform-specific implementations can share common modules

## Implementation Notes

- Maintain backward compatibility with the `IWindowManager` interface
- Use dependency injection for communication between modules
- Keep state management in the main `WindowManager` class
- Use callbacks for cross-module communication
- Ensure proper cleanup of event listeners and DOM elements
