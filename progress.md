## In Progress
- [ ] Test the dirrectory.exist in the filesystem. something dont work as expected
- [ ] Test path alias system implementation:
  - [ ] Test `~` alias resolves to user's home directory
  - [ ] Test dynamic path aliases like `/mnt`
  - [ ] Test symlinks with `alias`, `addalias`, and `rmalias` commands
  - [ ] Verify alias paths work with all filesystem operations (read/write/etc.)
- [x] Basic command implementation:
  - [x] Navigation: ls, pwd (cd handled by shell)
  - [x] File operations: cat, cp, mv, rm, mkdir, touch
  - [x] System commands: echo, ps, kill, clear
  - [x] Network commands: ping, curl, nmap
  - [x] Help and utilities: man
  - [x] Path alias commands: alias, addalias, rmalias
- [ ] Application development:
